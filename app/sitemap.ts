/**
 * Detail routes are enumerated from the ESPN 2026 NFL dataset (32 teams and
 * their divisions) so the sitemap can never claim a page the data cannot
 * fill. URLs are absolutized against the production origin — the sitemap
 * spec requires absolute <loc> values, and root-relative ones showed up as
 * GSC errors while the site sat on a stale build (2026-09-22 audit).
 *
 * lastmod is change-based: dataset routes stamp the dataset's own
 * generation date (it rebuilds around weekly) and stadium routes stamp each
 * stadium's lastVerified — only /injuries, which genuinely changes daily,
 * uses the current timestamp.

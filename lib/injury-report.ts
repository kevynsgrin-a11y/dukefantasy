/**
 * Weekly Injury Report — data layer (NFL).
 *
 * Two layers, kept separate on purpose:
 *  1. ESPN BASE — injury statuses fetched live by the Worker (/api/injuries)
 *     and snapshotted into the build. Always attributed to ESPN.
 *  2. EDITORIAL RESEARCH — practice participation, likelihood-to-play with
 *     confidence, and sourced sentiment from news + verified social accounts.
 *     Ingested weekly from data/injury-research/current.json via
 *     scripts/ingest-injury-research.mjs. Absent file = nothing published.
 *
 * Long-term ledger = Injured Reserve or expected out MORE than 2 weeks.
 * Everything else that is uncertain lives in the week-to-week watch.
 * Null means not published — never zero, never guessed.
